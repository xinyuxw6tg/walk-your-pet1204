        <p class="lead">Charlottesville is a town based on University of Virginia, so the population of this city is kind of mobile. Every year, new students or teachers come to this city. You may be a little confused when facing a strange city.

If you come here with your buddies, you can find Xia Village's most popular dog walking place on this website. Avoid traffic and keep your dogs safe. If you are a newbie who is just starting to raise dogs, meeting some friends who are experienced in raising dogs through popular dog walks may be of great help to you.

Have fun with your buddies!</p>
